# AI Chatbot Project
**Overview**
This repository contains the source code for an AI chatbot project aimed at developing an intelligent and interactive conversational agent powered by artificial intelligence. The chatbot is designed to understand natural language, engage in meaningful conversations with users, and provide relevant and helpful responses to their queries.

**Features**
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model**: Implements a robust NLP model capable of understanding and processing human language, including text parsing, entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and language generation.

2. **Dialogue Management System**: Develops a dialogue management system that maintains context, handles user responses, and generates appropriate follow-up questions or responses.

3. **Training Data**: Collects and curates a diverse dataset of conversational data to train the chatbot, covering various topics and conversational styles.

4. **Knowledge Base Integration**: Integrates a knowledge base or connects with relevant APIs to provide accurate and up-to-date information during conversations.

5. **User Interface**: Designs a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly, whether through a web application, mobile app, or other platforms.


# Implementation Details
1. **Languages and Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development. Utilizes Google Fonts for typography. Implements a chat interface with HTML and styles it with CSS. Utilizes JavaScript for interactive behavior and API communication.

2. **NLP Model Development**: Utilizes the OpenAI API for natural language processing. The API is accessed using JavaScript fetch requests to send user input and receive responses from the AI model.

3. **Dialogue System Design**: Designs a dialogue management system in JavaScript to handle multi-turn conversations and maintain context. Generates appropriate responses based on user inputs and AI model outputs.

4. **User Interface Development**: Designs and develops a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot. Implements responsive design for compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.
